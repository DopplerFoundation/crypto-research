# Truffle &rarr; Framework for Dapp Development

As of right now, it looks like Truffle is a great framework for building and testing smart contracts.

### Contract List
a) HelloWorld -- get/set a number <br/>
b) StructManipulation -- demonstrate how to instantiate a struct <br/>
c) MappingDemo -- demonstrate how insert/delete/get a mapping <br/>
d) ContractToContract1 (receiving contract) -- demonstrate contract to contract interaction <br/>
e) ContractToContract2 (sending contract) -- demonstrate contract to contract interaction <br/>
f) StructPlusMapping -- demonstrate a combination of mapping and struct

Install the NPM package.
```
npm install - truffle

Enter the Truffle Develop Console.
